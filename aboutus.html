              <p> At Eltham Family Dental, we take a different approach to your dental care - a personalised and affordable approach.  We originally started our practice because we knew there had to be a better way to treat patients.  Now it's our mission to provide customised, patient-friendly treatments at an affordable price.  We’ve been doing that here in Eltham for more than 30 years because we believe everyone should have access to great dental care.  We love the long-term relationships we’ve developed with our patients.  They’ve grown up with us and now we’re treating the third  generation of our dental clients!
                <br><br>
                A lot has changed in the 30 years since we’ve been here in leafy Eltham.  Today we have the latest dental technology and equipment so we can provide the highest quality dental care.  We’re always keeping a close eye and adapting to developments in dental care while we match the changing needs of our community.  Our dedication to our patients and the community remains the same through the last three decades.  Our dental practice is locally owned and operated and we proudly support our local sports clubs, community groups and other local businesses.  We believe that supporting our community means growing together.
                <br><br>
                We think of our team as a family and we’d love to treat your family too.  We specialise in children, families and seniors and find time in welcoming new patients to our clinic.  We offer a full range of dental services and  treatment customised to suit your individual needs.  Our team focuses on achieving good oral health through education and preventative dental treatments.  Eltham Family Dental has three dentists at the practice so call or click the appointment link today to book an appointment with Dr Indu Rose Joseph or Dr Rosalind Peart.  </p>

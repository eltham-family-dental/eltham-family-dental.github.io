Contrary to popular belief whitening treatments don't permanently whiten teeth, effects last from 1 months to 3 years depending on the whitening system used and lifestyle factors. If you expose your teeth to foods and beverages that cause staining you may see the whiteness start to fade in as little as 1 month after treatment. Those who avoid foods and beverages that stain may be able to wait one year or longer before another whitening treatment or touch-up is needed.
Some tips for prolonging the life of whitening;
- Avoid the consumption of or exposure to products that stain your teeth, such as coffee, tea, curry and red wine. If you do choose to consume beverages that stain, consider using a straw so that the liquid bypasses your front teeth.
- Rinse immediately after consuming stain-causing beverages or foods.
- Follow good oral hygiene practices. Brush your teeth at least twice daily, floss at least once daily to remove plaque
- Consider touch-up treatments. Depending on the whitening method used, you may need a touch-up every 6 months or after a year or two.
- If you smoke or drink lots of stain-causing beverages, you may need a touch up more often.

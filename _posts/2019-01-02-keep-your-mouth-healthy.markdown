#### Common dental problems - Adults over 60
- Darkened teeth - Caused, to some extent, by changes in dentin -- the bone-like tissue that underlies the tooth enamel -- and by a lifetime of consuming stain-causing foods and beverages. Also caused by thinning of the outer enamel layer that lets the darker yellower dentin show through.
- Dry mouth - Dry mouth is caused by reduced saliva flow, which can be a result of cancer treatments that use radiation to the head and neck area, as well as certain diseases, such as Sj√∂gren's syndrome, and medication side effects. Many medicines can cause dry mouth.
- Diminished sense of taste . While advancing age impairs the sense of taste, diseases, medications, and dentures can also contribute to this sensory loss.
- Root decay - This is caused by exposure of the tooth root to decay-causing acids. The tooth roots become exposed as gum tissue recedes from the tooth. Roots do not have any enamel to protect them and are more prone to decay than the crown part of the tooth.
- Gum disease - Caused by plaque and made worse by food left in teeth, use of tobacco products, poor-fitting bridges and dentures, poor diets, and certain diseases, such as anemia, cancer, and diabetes, this is often a problem for older adults.
- Tooth loss - Gum disease is a leading cause of tooth loss.
- Uneven jawbone - This is caused by tooth and then not replacing missing teeth. This allows the rest of the teeth to drift and shift into open spaces
- Denture-induced stomatitis - Ill-fitting dentures, poor dental hygiene, or a buildup of the fungus Candida albicans cause this condition, which is inflammation of the tissue underlying a denture.
- Thrush - Diseases or drugs that affect the immune system can trigger the overgrowth of the fungus Candida albicans in the mouth.

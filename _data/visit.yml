  It’s our pleasure to welcome new patients to Eltham Family Dental clinic. Our trusted and experienced team of dentists and dental assistants are proud to offer the highest level of dental care for you and your family.<br><br>
  During your first visit, we take the time to investigate, diagnose and ensure all your questions are answered. We also find out what you want to achieve, your previous dental experiences and how we can help you.<br><br>
  When we inspect your teeth and gums, we use an X-ray and an intra-oral camera to examine each tooth in detail. This examination checks for signs of disease in your mouth, jaw joints, lips, cheeks and tongue. We also check for secondary issues like grinding teeth and other systemic conditions like diabetes, cancer check etc . After this examination, we’ll then show you what we’ve found and give you options for treatment plans that are personalised for your needs. This ensures you as the patient is well informed before we start any treatment.<br><br>

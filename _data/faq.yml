  - q: Why is Eltham Family Dental not a preferred provider?
    a: |+
      In recent years some health funds have introduced “contracted dentist” schemes which claim to decrease your out-of-pocket costs. These schemes do not decrease your premiums or increase your annual limits. You may get lower gap payments with a contracted dentist, but you will be entitled to fewer claimable services in the same calendar year compared with a non-contracted dentist.

      Health fund rebates have not only failed to keep pace with costs associated with the provision of dental care, but the range of services claimable in a calendar year has also become increasingly restricted.

      By becoming a contracted dentist, the dentist agrees to accept the terms and fees set by the respective health fund. This guarantees a fixed and predictable treatment gap. However, “managed care” has its problems. Like most things, you get what you pay for.

      Such schemes assume all dental providers are the same and that the only factor influencing choice is “cost”. This is a limited view of a complex dentist-patient relationship, where trust, quality, and care are equally important.

      In summary, standards may drop while treatment failures and dissatisfaction increase. Remember, the health fund is a business, and the contracted dentist scheme is a business decision.

      Contracted dentist schemes remove patient rights to choose their clinician. At EFD, we believe this is not in your best interest. You should be free to see whichever dentist you please — not be dictated to by an insurance company.

      Ask our friendly staff about alternatives.

  - q: Is it safe to visit the dentist if I have a cold or a flu?
    a: |+
      Please reschedule your appointment if you are feeling unwell with cold or flu symptoms (fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat). This protects our staff and other patients.

      When lying back in the dental chair, congestion can worsen and you will be more comfortable when healthy. Wait until you have been symptom-free for 24–48 hours before rebooking.

      For dental emergencies while unwell, please call us to discuss urgent care options.
